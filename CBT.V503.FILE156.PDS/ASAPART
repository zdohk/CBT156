       While there is a large amount of information                      article
       available in the ASAP data, IBM has not yet                       article
       provided the System Programmer with any tools                     article

       the ASAP data has been strictly a manual                          article
       process. The IEBASAP utility program attempts                     article
       to reduce the manual effort involved in using                     article
       the ASAP data.                                                    article

     What is IEBASAP?                                                    article
                                                                         article
       IEBASAP is a utility program designed to                          article
       process the ASAP data from the IBM                                article
       ServiceLink application. The program                              article
       maintains the ASAP notification data in a                         article
       VSAM KSDS data set. The program will also                         article
       report on the contents of the data set.                           article
       IEBASAP has the capability to                                     article
       cross-reference the ASAP data with the                            article
       installation's SMP/E data to determine if                         article
       an installation has in-error maintenance                          article
       installed, or if any known fixing                                 article
       maintenance is installed. While the IEBASAP                       article
       program supports both MVS and VM ASAP data,                       article
       it can currently only be executed on an MVS                       article
       system.                                                           article

       IEBASAP has four primary commands; UPDATE,                        article
       LIST, XREF, and CLEANUP. The UPDATE command                       article
       is used to create and maintain the ASAP                           article
       data base. The LIST routine is used to                            article
       print the contents of the ASAP data base.                         article
       The XREF command is used to cross reference                       article
       the ASAP data base against an SMP/E TARGET                        article
       or DLIB zone. The CLEANUP command is used                         article
       to delete records from the ASAP data base                         article
       when the FMID in the ASAP record is no                            article
       longer in the SMP/E GLOBAL zone. Each of                          article
       these commands is discussed in greater                            article

       The SET command is used to indicate whether                       article
       the data being processed is MVS or VM and                         article
       to set the page length for the output                             article
       reports. The default data type is MVS and                         article
       the default page length is 60. The SET                            article

     Why IEBASAP?                                                        article
                                                                         article
       IEBASAP was written to help process an ever                       article
       increasing number of ASAP notifications. As                       article
       more FMIDs were placed in the ASAP profile,                       article
       the number of notifications received also                         article
       increased. Early on it had been decided to                        article
       'process' the ASAP notifications on a weekly                      article
       basis, rather than as they arrived. The                           article
       reason for this was that on some days there                       article
       might not be any new ASAP notifications or                        article
       the ASAP data would be the only reason for                        article
       logging onto IBMLink.                                             article
                                                                         article
       The weekly processing worked well with                            article
       smaller numbers of notifications, but the                         article
       larger shipments of notifications were                            article
       becoming difficult to process. The time to                        article
       review the notifications on IBMLink, then                         article
       print a copy to either a local printer or                         article
       to a userid on a local host, check the                            article
       notifications against the SMP/E data bases,                       article
       and so on, was growing. In addition to the                        article
       time involved in checking the ASAP data,                          article
       the overhead of maintaining a record of the                       article
       ASAP data increased as well.                                      article
                                                                         article
       Something was needed to help automate the                         article
       process. IEBASAP started simply as a way to                       article
       keep track of the ASAP notifications. It read                     article
       an input file consisting of the notifications                     article
       and created/updated the data base. The data                       article
       base was 'printed' using IDCAMS REPRO to copy                     article
       the data to a sequential data set and then                        article
       printed using IEBGENER.                                           article
                                                                         article
                                                                         article
     The ASAP Notifications                                              article
                                                                         article
       The ASAP notifications can be made available                      article
       for processing on the user's system in                            article
       multiple ways. The first is to print the data                     article
       to a local printer and then enter the data                        article
       manually. The second, and recommended method,                     article
       is to 'print' the data to a userid on a local                     article
       host. The data is sent in TSO                                     article
       TRANSMIT/RECEIVE format. The TSO RECEIVE                          article
       command is then used to retrieve the ASAP                         article
       data. Users that use dial-up access could                         article
       capture the data on their PC and then upload                      article
       the data to their host system.                                    article
                                                                         article
       The data is loaded with the following DCB                         article
       attributes; RECFM of FB, LRECL of 89, and a                       article
       BLKSIZE of 32752. The format of the ASAP                          article
       notifications is shown in Figure 2. The                           article
       names shown are those used by the program.                        article
       A sample of the ASAP notifications is shown                       article
       in Example 1. This sample will be the basis                       article
       for all IEBASAP examples.                                         article
                                                                         article
       It is recommended that the ASAP                                   article
       notifications be pre-sorted using the                             article
       control card shown in Figure 3. This will                         article
       insure that the notifications are processed                       article
       consistently each time the program is                             article
       executed.                                                         article

       The ASAP data base is a VSAM KSDS data set.                       article
       The IDCAMS control cards for the allocation                       article
       of the data set are listed in Figure 4. The                       article
       data set must be primed with a blank record                       article
       or IEBASAP will terminate with an error when                      article
       accessing the VSAM data set. The ASAP data                        article
       base is defined with a SHAREOPTIONS of 2,                         article
       allowing for an unrestricted number of read                       article

       The data base records are 72 bytes in length                      article
       and have a 16-byte key. The key for the ASAP                      article
       data base record consists of the APAR and the                     article
       FMID from the ASAP notification. The FMID in                      article
       the ASAP notification is nine bytes long.                         article
       This is because the VM notifications use a                        article
       9-byte component identifier versus the 7-byte                     article
       MVS FMID. The format of the ASAP data base                        article
       records is shown in Figure 5. The names shown                     article
